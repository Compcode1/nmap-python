Network security assessments require efficient and accurate scanning techniques to identify active devices, open ports, and running services. This project explores how to integrate Nmap with Python to perform network scans, analyze device responses, and compare different scanning techniques.

By leveraging Python’s automation capabilities with Nmap, we conducted both non-aggressive (-sV -T4) and aggressive (-A) scans on a local network to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of each approach. The results provided insights into how different scan types affect detection accuracy and scan duration.

This project highlights:
✔️ Setting up Nmap in Python for automated network scanning.
✔️ Comparing standard vs. aggressive scans to evaluate effectiveness.
✔️ Identifying open ports and services on different devices.
✔️ Understanding dynamic port behavior on devices like MacBooks and iPhones.

Through this hands-on analysis, we gained a deeper understanding of network scanning methodologies and how Python enhances cybersecurity automation.
