    "Network security assessments require efficient and accurate scanning techniques to identify active devices, open ports, and running services. This project explores how to integrate Nmap with Python to perform network scans, analyze device responses, and compare different scanning techniques.\n",

    "Running one scan from the command line is easy, but what if you need to scan your network every hour?\n",
